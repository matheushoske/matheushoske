# Matheus Hoske

Software Engineer & Product Builder  
Founder at Hoskes Desenvolvimento de Sistemas

I build **production-grade software**, focusing on **scalability, automation, and AI-driven products**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **engineering, architecture, and business execution**.

## Market-Oriented Engineering

I don’t build demos.  
I build **systems designed to operate, scale, and generate value**.

My projects are developed with:
- Clear business rules
- Explicit architecture decisions
- Long-term maintainability
- Cost-aware infrastructure
- Market validation in mind

---

## Current Focus

- AI-driven SaaS products
- Autonomous AI agents for software development
- Event-driven systems and distributed architectures
- High-throughput APIs and background processing
- Products with measurable traction and monetization paths

---

## Core Expertise

### Backend & Architecture
- C# / .NET (ASP.NET Core, Web API, Blazor)
- Event-driven architecture (RabbitMQ)
- Background processing (Hangfire)
- RESTful APIs & system integration
- Legacy system modernization

### AI & Automation
- LLM-based applications
- Chatbots with domain-specific intelligence
- Large dataset ingestion and contextual memory
- AI orchestration and workflow automation

### Infrastructure

## Engineering Philosophy

- Architecture precedes implementation
- Business logic is a first-class concern
- Automation reduces operational risk
- Code quality directly impacts valuation
- AI is a leverage tool, not a shortcut

---

## Product Visibility

Some projects are listed on external discovery platforms to measure market interest and engagement.  
Metrics, traction, and adoption are treated as **engineering signals**, not marketing vanity.

---

## Contact & Collaboration

Open to:
- Strategic partnerships
- AI & SaaS product collaboration
- Infrastructure-heavy or system-critical projects
